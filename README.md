# WeatherStation

An almost-working example of the Observer pattern. I am working through the [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do) book, but the examples are in Java, so I decided to adapt them into PHP as an exercise.

## TODO
- remove extra require statements from before composer was added to project
- fix/update WeatherStation.php
- fix `display()` method so it's easier to test
